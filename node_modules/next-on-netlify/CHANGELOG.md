# Changelog

## 2.4.0 (2020-09-05)

- Add support for base64 encoding in responses returned from SSR pages and API
  endpoints
- Reduce the number of rewrites generated by skipping SSG & HTML pages with
  static routing. These pages are routed automatically by Netlify ([#26](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/26))
- Limit the default number of lines of build output to 50. More or fewer lines can be shown by running `next-on-netlify` with the option `--max-log-lines XX`. See `next-on-netlify --help` and [this comment](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/26#issuecomment-660684261).
- Remove workaround for making `404.html` work with `netlify dev`. The
  workaround is no longer required because [`netlify dev` has been patched](https://github.com/netlify/cli/pull/1159).

## 2.3.2 (2020-08-04)

- Fix: Bump elliptic to v6.5.3 to fix [CVE-2020-13822](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vh7m-p724-62c2)

## 2.3.1 (2020-07-19)

- Fix: Correctly get distDir from `next.config.js` when config is a function ([#25](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/25))

## 2.3.0 (2020-06-26)

- Add support for [NextJS Preview Mode](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/preview-mode) ([#10](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/10))

  Note: NextJS Preview Mode does not work on pages that are pre-rendered (pages with `getStaticProps`). Netlify currently does not support cookie-based redirects, which are needed for supporting preview mode on pre-rendered pages. Preview mode works correctly on any server-side-rendered pages (pages with `getInitialProps` or `getServerSideProps`).

- Use `multiValueHeaders` in Netlify Functions for incoming requests and for outgoing responses. This offers many benefits over plain `headers`, such as setting multiple cookies within one response.

## 2.2.0 (2020-06-22)

- Add support for defining custom redirects in a `_redirects` file at the project root directory. Unlike redirects specified in your `netlify.toml` file, the redirects from the `_redirects` file take precedence over those generated by `next-on-netlify` ([#21](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/pull/21))

## 2.1.0 (2020-06-14)

- Add support for [NextJS optional catch-all routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/dynamic-api-routes#optional-catch-all-api-routes) ([#15](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/pull/15))
- Fix: An `index.js` page with `getStaticProps` no longer causes `next-on-netlify` to fail ([#18](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/pull/18))
- Fix: Catch-all routes now correctly require that at least one URL parameter is present (unlike optional catch-all routes) ([479b7e7](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/commit/479b7e73f1a11778eb5ef66ded02aa1c17e38697))
- Fix: Data routes now correctly work for pages with catch-all routing ([0412b45](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/commit/0412b45fe3917a082be563c1720e85cf3affd4e1))

## 2.0.0 (2020-06-02)

- **Breaking: You must change your `netlify.toml` configuration for next-on-netlify v2.0.0.** Please [look at the README](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify#3-configure-netlify) for the latest configuration.  
  `next-on-netlify` now builds pre-rendered pages and static assets in `out_publish`. Netlify Functions for SSR pages are built to `out_functions`.
- Add support for `getStaticProps` ([#7](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/7))
- Add support for `getStaticPaths` with and without fallback ([#7](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/7))
- Add support for `getServerSideProps` ([#7](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/7))
- Query string parameters are now correctly passed to Next Pages and API endpoints ([#9](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/9))
- Response headers are now correctly set ([#9](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/9#issuecomment-633288179))
- When a user encounters a 404, `next-on-netlify` now display the NextJS 404 page rather than Netlify's default 404 page. You can [customize the NextJS 404 page](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page#customizing-the-404-page).
  ([#2](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/issues/2))
- Every page with server-side rendering is now converted to a stand-alone Netlify Function. Previously, all SSR pages were bundled in a single Netlify Function.
- `next-on-netlify` now prints out which pages are being converted to Netlify Functions for SSR, which pages are served as pre-rendered HTML, and the redirects that are being generated.
- Adding custom redirects via a `_redirects` file in the project root is no longer supported. Let me know if you want this back. Or define your redirects in `netlify.toml`.

## 1.2.0 (2020-04-26)

- Add support for custom NextJS build directory: If `distDir` is specified in
  `next.config.js`, next-on-netlify will use that directory. If no `distDir` is
  specified, it will look for the default directory (`.next`).

## 1.1.0 (2020-04-19)

- Add support for catch-all routes ([#1](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/pull/1), [#5](https://github.com/netlify/next-on-netlify/pull/5))
- README: Fix instructions for local preview

## 1.0.1 (2020-01-27)
